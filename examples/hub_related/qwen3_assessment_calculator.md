The Calculator tool has been thoroughly examined, particularly focusing on the `help` method and its related functionalities. Here's a summary of what was tested and verified:

### ‚úÖ Functionality Verified

1. **Allowed Functions**:
   - The function `calculator-list_allowed_fns` successfully returned a comprehensive list of supported functions.
   - These include basic arithmetic, statistical, financial, and advanced mathematical operations.

2. **Help Documentation**:
   - For each function tested (`add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, etc.), the `calculator-help` method correctly returned its description, arguments, and return value.
   - This includes user-defined calculator functions as well as standard math functions inherited from Python‚Äôs `math` module (e.g., `sin`, `cos`, `log`, `sqrt`).

3. **Evaluate Method**:
   - The `calculator-evaluate` method correctly parsed and executed complex expressions combining multiple functions.
   - Valid expressions like `add(2, 3) * pow(2, 3) + sqrt(16)` were evaluated accurately.
   - Financial, combinatorial, and statistical expressions such as `compound_interest`, `perm`, `average`, and `standard_deviation` were also validated.

### üìå Example Expressions Successfully Evaluated

| Expression | Result |
|------------|--------|
| `add(2, 3) * pow(2, 3) + sqrt(16)` | `44.0` |
| `compound_interest(1000, 0.05, 3)` | `1157.625` |
| `simple_interest(1000, 0.05, 3)` | `150.0` |
| `gcd(12, 18)` | `6` |
| `lcm(12, 18)` | `36` |
| `factorial(5)` | `120` |
| `comb(5, 2)` | `10` |
| `perm(5, 2)` | `20` |
| `average([2, 4, 6, 8])` | `5.0` |
| `median([3, 1, 4, 2])` | `2.5` |
| `mode([1, 2, 2, 3, 4])` | `[2]` |
| `standard_deviation([2, 4, 6, 8])` | ~`2.236` |
| `min([5, 1, 8, 3])` | `1` |
| `max([5, 1, 8, 3])` | `8` |
| `sum([2, 4, 6, 8])` | `20` |
| `prod([2, 4, 6, 8])` | `384` |
| `euclidean_dist([0, 0], [3, 4])` | `5.0` |
| `euclidean_norm(3, 4)` | `5.0` |
| `abs(-5)` | `5` |
| `mod(10, 3)` | `1` |

### üîç Observations

- The help system is robust and provides accurate documentation for all available functions.
- The `evaluate` method supports both calculator-specific functions and standard math functions.
- Some built-in math functions (like `log`) did not provide detailed docstrings but still worked in evaluation.

### üß™ Conclusion

The Calculator tool, especially its `help` and `evaluate` methods, works effectively and reliably for a wide variety of mathematical computations. It is well-suited for use in scenarios requiring both simple calculations and complex formula evaluations with proper documentation support.
